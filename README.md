# Churn-Healthcare-IT-Service-
Churn Analysis for Healthcare IT Service. A Predictive Analytic Solution and Customer Retention Strategy.

  **Service** 
  
  Digital Healthcare Resource Application for Providers
  
  **Objective** 
  
  Develop effective process to predict churn before customers terminate service
  
  **Approach**
  
     1. Create Project Plan and Pilot for proof of concept
     
     2. Present to executive leadership team for buy-in 
     
     3. Establish Analytic Architecture
     
     4. Build Refined Machine Learning Model
     
          o	Try multiple Algorithms
          
              •Random Forest (RF)
              
              •Support Vector Machine (SVM)
              
              •Generalized Linear Model (GLM)
              
          o	Train on historic data
          
          o	Test on unseen data
          
      5. Implement production and maintenance plan
      
**Results** 

      •	Random Forest (RF) Model consistently performed best on unseen data
      
      •	91% accurate on predicting customers who churn
      
      •	85.1% overall accuracy
      
      •	Proposed retention plan estimates $1.4M in savings resulting from Predictive Analytic Solution
